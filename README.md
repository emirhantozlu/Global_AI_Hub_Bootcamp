# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project 📊📷

## Project Goal 🎯

The aim of this project is to perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project involves comprehensive analysis of image data, selection of appropriate machine learning models, and classification of images in the dataset using these models.

## Datasets Used 📚

**CIFAR-10 Dataset:** The CIFAR-10 dataset contains a total of 60,000 color images across 10 different classes. The classes include airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The images are 32x32 pixels in size and are stored in RGB format.

## Project and Research Steps 🛠️

1. **Dataset Selection:** The CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen and used.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, and other preprocessing steps were performed.
3. **Models Used:**
   - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Model:** Trained using convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from image data.
   - **Random Forest Model:** Used as an ensemble method to learn features and classes from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Model Training and Performance Evaluation 📈

**CNN Model Performance:**
- Accuracy: 64.54% ✅
- F1 Score: 0.6416
- ROC AUC Score: 0.944

**Random Forest Model Performance:**
- Accuracy: 46.54% ❌
- F1 Score: 0.4621
- ROC AUC Score: 0.853

## Key Findings 🔍

The performance metrics obtained during the project indicate that the CNN model achieved higher accuracy and better F1 score compared to the Random Forest model. These results highlight the effectiveness and performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks.
